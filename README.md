# Epigenetic Age Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
Ageing is more than just a number. It's a biological process influenced by genetics, environment, and epigenetics. This project leverages machine learning to predict an individual's age based on DNA methylation data from 27,578 CpG sites. This approach has applications in biomedical research, precision medicine, and longevity studies. Unlike traditional age estimators, this model identifies patterns in epigenetic markers to assess cellular ageing more accurately.

##  Why It Matters
DNA methylation-based age prediction has applications in biological ageing research, forensics, and health diagnostics. Optimizing these models can improve ageing studies and personalized medicine.
