# Epigenetic Age Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
Aging is more than just a number. It's a biological process influenced by genetics, environment, and epigenetics. This project leverages machine learning to predict an individual's age based on DNA methylation data from 27,578 CpG sites. This approach has applications in biomedical research, precision medicine, and longevity studies. Unlike traditional age estimators, this model identifies patterns in epigenetic markers to assess cellular aging more accurately.
